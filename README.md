Intitial Description of the Project TBD

Thursday, November 7th:

    Files & Classes:
        BountyHunter.cpp (Driver)

        Tree.h

        Data Class: TBD (has to be different from last projects)
            Ideas:
                -> Candy dispay case (Set price, kind of candy, color, amount of candy, etc)
                    (I also like the idea of a macaroon display case/ shop)


                -> DVD case (Set rating of movie, type of movie, name, actors(?), how many copies of movie)


                -> Pantry(Set price, kind of food, how much of it, is it going bad(?))
                    (maybe main function is setting buy date. Set buy date and after a set amount of days how much food has gone bad.)


                -> Bounty Hunter (Enter values for each suspect(eye color, name, age, build), searches for set wanted criminal)
                    (determines whether or not the criminal is found.) (prints out list of entered suspects)(My favorite so far.)
            
            Final Idea:                
                -> Bounty Hunter (Enter values for each suspect(eye color, name, age, build), searches for set wanted criminal)
                    (determines whether or not the criminal is found.) (prints out list of entered suspects)(My favorite so far.)
